# Auto Rule

- Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
  library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
  tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

# Gemini Added Memories

- The user prefers that references (sources, numbered links) are removed from future notes.
- The user prefers to use hyphens in filenames instead of underscores.
